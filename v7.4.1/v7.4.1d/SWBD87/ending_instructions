Post installation instructions:

A system WITHOUT A CHASSIS for a FIRST TIME LOAD the next steps are:
   1. You may now reboot the system. Be sure you have a console
      connection to the system before rebooting.
   2. Run 'host_setup <ipaddress> CP<serialnumber(6 digit)>' once the
      system is back up to allow the network interface(s) to work.
   3. Since there are no fans connected to the board, the thermal and
      voltage monitoring policies in the software need to be bypassed.

      Run 'touch /var/emd.factory' (bypasses thermal and voltage)
      Run 'touch /mnt/var/emd.factory' (bypasses thermal and voltage)

   4. Initialize the non-volitile system hardware descriptions for
      software.
      Run '/fabos/xtool/seepromInit.xtl -T' to configure the FRU data.
   5. Run 'chkconfig fabos on' to enable Fabric OS.
   6. Run 'sync' to save the config changes in flask.
   7. Reboot the system once more for changes to take effect.
   8. Run 'ipaddrset' to set the ip address when fabos is on
